# Wine Classifcation

---


This is a Beginner project on Classification.  
I have implemented Logistic Regression and a Two Layer Neural Network, completely from scratch.
<br>

>The Neural Network is still being Trained, it will be completed Soon.


The dataset used is the Red Wine Dataset: https://github.com/Epoch-IITH/2022---2023/tree/main/Core%20Selection%20Hackathon

The Solver I have implemented uses Stochastic Gradient Descent <br>
It can also use Stochastic Graident Descent with *Momentum*
