# Wine Classifcation

This is a Beginner project on Classification.  
I have implemented Logistic Regression and a Two Layer Neural Network, completely from scratch.
<br>

>The Neural Network is still being Trained, it will be completed Soon.


The dataset used is the Red Wine Dataset: https://github.com/Epoch-IITH/2022---2023/tree/main/Core%20Selection%20Hackathon

The Solver I have implemented uses Stochastic Gradient Descent <br>

It can also use Stochastic Graident Descent with `Momentum`

$
\begin{align}
    v_P = \mu * v_P - \alpha * \frac{\partial J}{\partial P}
    \\
    P = P + v_P
\end{align}
$
